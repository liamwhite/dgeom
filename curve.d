/**
 * Abstract continuous curve on a plane defined on [0,1].
 *
 * Formally, a curve in 2Geom is defined as a function
 * \f$\mathbf{C}: [0, 1] \to \mathbb{R}^2\f$
 * (a function that maps the unit interval to points on a 2D plane). Its image (the set of points
 * the curve passes through) will be denoted \f$\mathcal{C} = \mathbf{C}[ [0, 1] ]\f$.
 * All curve types available in 2Geom are continuous and differentiable on their
 * interior, e.g. \f$(0, 1)\f$. Sometimes the curve's image (value set) is referred to as the curve
 * itself for simplicity, but keep in mind that it's not strictly correct.
 * 
 * It is common to think of the parameter as time. The curve can then be interpreted as
 * describing the position of some moving object from time \f$t=0\f$ to \f$t=1\f$.
 * Because of this, the parameter is frequently called the time value.
 *
 * Some methods return pointers to newly allocated curves. They are expected to be freed
 * by the caller when no longer used. Default implementations are provided for some methods.
